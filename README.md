Employing programs that meet a maintainable, readable, and adaptable standard, I apply transferable and modular approaches to my code enabling word swapping, or regarding the CRUD module, database swaps to allow for access for alternate databases via MongoDB. I utilized this approach in the creation of the CRUD module allowing for the program to be easily manipulated with minimal fuss. 

For the creation of the Grazioso Salvare Dashboard, critical thinking and research analysis was easily the most used skill not only for this assignment but for the entirity of the course. For the dashboard in particular, this varied as we were requiremed to impliment new functionalities that we had not yet used in previous assignments such as graphing visualizations. In the future, I would apply the same approach for creating databases to meet client requests. Our best resource are our peers. 

To be brief, a Computer Scientist discovers and interprets challenges and tests their solution. In parallel with the Grazioso Salvare dashboard, employing this modality and aformentioned software best practices allows for companies lke Grazioso Salvare to quickly manipulate programs and enable short cuts for future expansions and projects. The modularity of the software provides cost and space efficient practices for companies and their future endevours.
